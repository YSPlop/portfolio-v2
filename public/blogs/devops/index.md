## I'm building a CI/CD pipeline in 7 days

In this DevOps challenge, I'm learning about continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) by building a full deployment pipeline using AWS services. Each day focuses on a specific step—from setting up a cloud-based web app to automating builds, managing dependencies, and deploying code changes seamlessly.

By the end of the 7 days, I will have a fully functional CI/CD pipeline that connects a GitHub repository to AWS, automatically builds and packages my application, and deploys it to the cloud—giving me hands-on experience with real-world DevOps tools like CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline.

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside 3 hours every day for a week to work on this challenge. I will keep myself accountable my doing it as soon as i finish work for the day. My reward for completing this Devops challenge will be a nice sweet treat.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines development (writing code) and operations (deploying and maintaining code) to shorten development cycles and deliver reliable software.
DevOps engineers implement DevOps practices in their organization. They
- Build automated pipelines (e.g. using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, GitHub Actions) that test, package, and deploy software, so releases become faster and more reliable.
- Containerize applications using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which helps applications scale.
- Turn cloud infrastructure into code (e.g. AWS CloudFormation, Terraform), so teams can create and manage resources more efficiently than manually configuring them.

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This process helps teams by automating the steps between writing code and delivering it to users. It ensures that code changes are regularly integrated, automatically built, tested, and deployed to production with minimal manual effort. This reduces bugs, speeds up releases, and makes the software delivery process more reliable and efficient.
